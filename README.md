# Vulkan Explorations

This is a set of hastily thrown together experiments as I learn Vulkan. The code is very ugly and building is kinda hacky.

Current goal:
 * Hello Image

Project TODO:
 * Module-ize and use RAII for Vulkan resources
 * Explore memory management stategies
 * etc.

Done: 
 * ~~Switch build system to CMake~~
 * ~~Add dependencies to version control, OR use Conan~~
